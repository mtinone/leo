I have my headphones on in the office while typing out emails, best regards, please, and I'm humming to country music because it keeps me calm and makes me think things will be alright. Like the office, simple and gray. Staying checked out is key to clocking myself in. Three minutes have passed. I'm still here in the silence between the song fading out and the next one starting in. 



I remember the sound of the passing time bell in high school. It reminded me of a stovetop timer, the single automaton tone echoing in the hallways, everybody pouring out of the classrooms, only to pour straight back into the classrooms for the next period. I think of Hansel tricking the blind witch into believing he was too skinny to be placed in her oven. Were we ever ready for consumption, for the real world, for whatever it was we were waiting for? In the empty office, I'm grown up and dancing, ever so slightly to music only I can hear. In the two seconds I spend walking between two glass walls, I realize my singing echoes, and I wonder if my voice carries.



Sometimes I switch from country to the K-pop playlist my friend sent me because it helps me remember my friends at large. I can't sing to the music except for the flashes of English in the choruses. Between silences, I realize I'm proofing spreadsheets, then I'm singing, then I'm silent again. Anyone paying attention to me would know that I'm intermittently saying "[dreams come true](https://youtu.be/H69tJmsgd9I)" as I stare at my computer monitors. Maybe that's why people don't talk to me as much as I wished they did. Five songs go by. If I hit shuffle, and keep my playlist on loop, time will never really end, and I get to be here until I decide to leave.  



It takes me a chorus and a verse to get to the train station. The conductor says six minutes until the next stop. I feel my heart move as the train accelerates, except I'm still, and I still remember the sound of passing time, and I still keep the music in my ears so that I can keep it out.❈

Marina Tinone is a writer who creates the things they wish they could have held when they were growing up. Their writing tends to focus on youth, memory, and responsibility. They are also fascinated by digital culture, cultural perception, and self-reception. Their Pushcart Prize-nominated essay, "[Beyond the Sea](https://www.mtinone.com/portfolio/beyond-the-sea/)", can be found in the inaugural Connecticut Literary Anthology (2020), and their prose poem "[HMU](https://www.mtinone.com/portfolio/hmu/)" can be read online in Digital America. 

Marina is also an independent scholar of Asian American youth literature and culture. Following [Rudine Sims Bishop's windows and mirrors](https://ncte.org/blog/2016/02/windows-mirrors-sliding-doors/), Marina's interest is in the "frames" of these windows and mirrors. Marina's focus is on the incidental and/or intentional context surrounding window and mirror texts and how this context shapes the reception and perception of a racialized American identity. 

You are welcome to subscribe to their email newsletter, "[Happy Friday](http://tinyletter.com/mtinone)", as they continue to grow into their life.

Marina Tinone is a writer who creates the things they wish they could have held when they were growing up. Their writing tends to focus on youth, memory, and responsibility. They are also fascinated by digital culture, cultural perception, and self-reception. Their Pushcart Prize-nominated essay, "[Beyond the Sea](https://www.mtinone.com/portfolio/beyond-the-sea/)", can be found in the inaugural Connecticut Literary Anthology (2020), and their prose poem "[HMU](https://www.mtinone.com/portfolio/hmu/)" can be read online in Digital America. 

Marina is also a youth literature scholar. Following Rudine Sims Bishop's [windows, mirrors, and sliding glass doors](https://ncte.org/blog/2016/02/windows-mirrors-sliding-doors/), Marina's interest is in the "frames" of how window and mirror texts published in the United States, alongside their contextualizing educational materials, textbooks, and advertisements, can impact understanding and reception of social justice issues.  

You are welcome to subscribe to their creative writing newsletter, "[Happy Friday](https://buttondown.email/mtinone)", as they continue to grow into their life. Please also feel free to follow Marina on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mtinone/).

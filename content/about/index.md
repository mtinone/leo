Marina Tinone is a writer who creates the things they wish they could have held when they were growing up. Their writing tends to focus on youth, memory, and responsibility. They are also fascinated by digital culture, cultural perception, and self-reception. Their Pushcart Prize-nominated essay, "[Beyond the Sea](https://www.mtinone.com/portfolio/beyond-the-sea/)", can be found in the inaugural Connecticut Literary Anthology (2020), and their prose poem "[HMU](https://www.mtinone.com/portfolio/hmu/)" can be read online on Digital America. 

You are welcome to follow their weekly writing on their [](https://mtinone.substack.com/p/coming-soon)[TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/mtinone), "Happy Friday", as they continue to grow into their life.
